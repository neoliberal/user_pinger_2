# user\_pinger\_2

This is a rewrite of user\_pinger that implements many new QoL features including:

* Multi-group pinging (eg. DOG&KITTY)
* Group aliases (eg. CAT refers to KITTY)
* group activity counter in the documentation that is updated automatically
* A website for managing subscriptions (good for new users who can't DM)
* Root comment button
* Undo button for when you accidentally unsubscribe from all
* Doesn't require tech skills to manage groups

Soon to be added features include:

* Faster pings (deleted/suspended/inactive users get pruned)
* Less cluttered documentation (inactive groups are automatically hidden)

Possible features for the future:

* Ping digests?
* Hide inactive groups?
* Public ping log?

This bot is currently very much a WIP and probably doesn't even run yet. It should be in a workable state soon, with some better documentation as well.
