# About

Pings are a way of sending messages to a group of people within /r/${primary_subreddit}. When someone writes `!ping [GROUP]` in a comment, everyone subscribed to GROUP will get a message from /u/${bot_username} containing a link to that comment.

For example, if you post a link to a cat picture, and add `!ping KITTY` to the comment, everyone who is subscribed to KITTY will receive a message with a link to your comment.

## Managing Subscriptions

To subscribe to a group, you can click on one of the links in the "Ping Groups" table below. This will open a private message to /u/${bot_username} with the command already written for you. You just need to send the message.

Alternatively, you can write the message manually. To do [action], send a message to /u/${bot_username} with [body text] in the body of the message. Please note that Reddit Chat does not work, you must use private messages.

Action | Body Text
|---|---|
Subscribe to [GROUP] | subscribe [GROUP]
Unsubscribe from [GROUP] | unsubscribe [GROUP]
[List my subscriptions](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=${bot_username}&subject=List%20my%20subscriptions&message=list_my_subscriptions) | list_my_subscriptions
[Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=${bot_username}&subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&message=unsubscribe) | unsubscribe

If you have a new account that is unable to send DMs you can also [manage your subscriptions on neoliber.al](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/)

## Rules / Etiquette

If you see a ping you think breaks the rules, please report it and [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2F${primary_subreddit}). Users who repeatedly break these rules may be banned from a ping or the subreddit as a whole

* **Don't Spam:** Listen to the group and try to only send pings others want to receive
* **Don't Brigade:** Avoid posting links to subreddits that are likely to cause drama. Absolutely do not encourage participation in any linked threads
* **Don't Harass:** Avoid using pings for "dunks" that target particular users, regardless of intent
* **Don't Delete Pings:** Getting a link to a bad ping is still less obnoxious than getting a link to a deleted comment

## Tips

* To ping a group, you must first subscribe to that group.
* No one except the mods can see what groups you're subscribed to
* Mods may occasionally ping groups for administrative reasons, like strawpolls for new group proposals, and announcing spinoff groups
* /u/${bot_username} does not pay attention to posts that are edited. If you mess up a ping, you'll have to post another comment
* If you would like a ping group to be created, make a post in /r/metaNL
* This bot is [open source](https://github.com/neoliberal/user_pinger_2/) and development is ongoing. See our [issues page](https://github.com/neoliberal/user_pinger_2/issues) for upcoming features and bug fixes
